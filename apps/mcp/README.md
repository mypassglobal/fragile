# @fragile.app/mcp

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the [Fragile](https://github.com/your-org/fragile)
engineering metrics dashboard. Exposes 19 read-only tools, 2 resources, and 4 prompt templates
over stdio — compatible with Claude Desktop, Claude Code (CLI), Cursor, GitHub Copilot agent
mode, and any other MCP-compatible AI client.

## What it does

Fragile caches Jira data in PostgreSQL and computes DORA metrics, sprint planning accuracy,
cycle time, roadmap coverage, and hygiene gaps. This MCP server gives AI assistants direct,
typed access to all of that data — no manual API calls required.

## Quick start

```bash
npx -y @fragile.app/mcp
```

The server reads two environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `API_BASE_URL` | **Yes** | Base URL of the Fragile API, e.g. `https://api.your-fragile-domain.com` |
| `API_KEY` | **Yes** | Your personal Fragile API key. Generate one in the app under **API Keys**. Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. The API requires authentication — an unset or invalid key returns 401. |

## Claude Desktop setup

Add the following to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
(macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fragile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@fragile.app/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.your-fragile-domain.com",
        "API_KEY": "frg_your_generated_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The Fragile tools will appear in the tool picker.

> **Generating a key:** log in to the Fragile web app, open **API Keys** from the sidebar,
> click **Generate key**, and copy it immediately — it is shown only once. The key carries
> your access level and can be revoked at any time from the same page.

## Cursor setup

Add the following to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your home directory or project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fragile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@fragile.app/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.your-fragile-domain.com",
        "API_KEY": "frg_your_generated_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Generating a key:** same as Claude Desktop — open **API Keys** in the Fragile web app,
> click **Generate key**, and copy it immediately.

## Claude Code (CLI) setup

Add the server with `claude mcp add`:

```bash
claude mcp add fragile \
  --env API_BASE_URL=https://api.your-fragile-domain.com \
  --env API_KEY=frg_your_generated_key \
  -- npx -y @fragile.app/mcp
```

By default the server is scoped to the current project. Use `--scope user` to make it
available across all your projects, or `--scope project` to share it with the team via a
`.mcp.json` file committed to the repo (put the key in an environment variable rather than
committing it).

Verify and inspect:

```bash
claude mcp list          # confirm "fragile" is connected
claude mcp get fragile   # show its configuration
```

The Fragile tools are then available in any `claude` CLI session. Remove with
`claude mcp remove fragile`.

> **Generating a key:** same as above — open **API Keys** in the Fragile web app,
> click **Generate key**, and copy it immediately.

## Local development

```bash
cd apps/mcp
npm install
npm run build   # compile TypeScript to dist/
npm test        # run Vitest unit tests
```

## Publishing

The package is published automatically via GitHub Actions on every push to `main` that
changes files under `apps/mcp/**`. Publishing is skipped if the current version in
`package.json` is already present on npm, so a version bump is required to trigger a
new release.

To publish a new version:
1. Bump the version in `apps/mcp/package.json` (`npm version patch`, `minor`, or `major`).
2. Commit and push to `main` (or merge a PR that includes the version bump).

GitHub Actions will detect the new version, build the package, and publish it to npm.

```bash
# example — bump patch version locally before opening a PR
cd apps/mcp
npm version patch
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will publish once the version-bumped commit lands on `main`.

### Required GitHub secret

Add `NPM_TOKEN` to the repository's Actions secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions).
The token must be a granular access token scoped to publish `@fragile.app/mcp`.

## Architecture

```
AI Client (Claude Desktop / Copilot / Cursor)
  │  MCP tool call (JSON-RPC over stdio)
  ▼
@fragile.app/mcp  (this package, spawned as a subprocess)
  │  HTTP GET with Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
  ▼
Fragile API  (NestJS REST API, port 3001)
  │  TypeORM queries
  ▼
PostgreSQL 16  (data pre-cached by scheduled Jira sync)
```

The MCP server is **entirely read-only** — every tool makes only `GET` requests. It cannot
create, update, or delete anything in Fragile or Jira.
