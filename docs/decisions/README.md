# Decision Log

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Fragile
DORA & Planning Metrics Dashboard project. Each file documents a significant
technical or architectural decision, the options that were considered, and the
rationale for the choice made.

ADRs are append-only. Superseded decisions are marked `Superseded by [NNNN]` and
a new ADR is created for the replacement decision.

| [0089](0089-change-scoped-snapshot-recompute.md) | Board-level dirty tracking in `syncAll`: incremental sync recomputes only boards whose watermarked fetch wrote something (+ org iff any dirty); full/daily sync recomputes all (backstop). Removes the hourly full-recompute waste. Builds on 0078 | Accepted | 2026-08-12 |
| [0090](0090-snapshot-config-reconciliation.md) | Reconcile snapshot config: staleness fallback aligned to 2880 min (docs); Lambda TF sizing/invocation (3008MB/300s/RequestResponse) documented vs stale 0040 figures; board-config change now refreshes the org snapshot too. Refines 0040 | Accepted | 2026-08-12 |
| [0091](0091-healthcheck-support-inclusion-toggle.md) | Healthcheck `includeSupport` param (default true): when false, support tickets are excluded from the Stability & Roadmap denominator + numerators (Support dimension unaffected); applied to selected week + trend; surfaced as a URL toggle + MCP param.
