# Decision Log

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Fragile
DORA & Planning Metrics Dashboard project. Each file documents a significant
technical or architectural decision, the options that were considered, and the
rationale for the choice made.

ADRs are append-only. Superseded decisions are marked `Superseded by [NNNN]` and
a new ADR is created for the replacement decision.
