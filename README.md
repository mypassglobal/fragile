# Fragile

Fragile is a self-hosted engineering metrics dashboard that connects to a Jira Cloud instance
and surfaces DORA metrics, sprint and Kanban planning analytics, cycle time analysis, and
roadmap accuracy tracking. It is designed for small engineering teams who want actionable
delivery data without leaving their existing Jira workflow.

All Jira data is synced into a local PostgreSQL database on demand. Metric calculations run
against the cached data, keeping the UI fast and Jira API usage low. Every aspect of the metric
rules — done statuses, failure issue types, incident definitions, roadmap date field IDs — is
configurable per board through the Settings UI, with no hardcoded assumptions in the codebase.

Access is controlled via Google Workspace SSO — any user in the configured Google Workspace domain
can log in. The first user to log in becomes an admin; subsequent users are read-only by default.
Admin users can manage board configuration, trigger syncs, and promote other users.

## Features

### Healthcheck

The Healthcheck page is the landing view — a weekly org-wide engineering scorecard. For a
selected ISO week it pools three scores across all contributing boards: **Stability** (share of
started tickets that were committed or carried over at sprint start; Scrum only), **Roadmap**
(share of started tickets linked to a JPD idea; Scrum only), and **Support** (share of started
tickets classified as reactive support; all boards, lower is better). Each score pools
numerators and denominators across boards, and an 8-week trend is shown alongside. Weeks with no
qualifying tickets render as N/A rather than zero.

### DORA Metrics

The DORA page shows all four DORA metrics — Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change
Failure Rate, and MTTR — at the organisation level and broken down per board. Toggle between week
and quarter views. Each metric card carries a DORA band badge (Elite / Good / Fair / Poor) derived
from the DORA research thresholds, and a board breakdown table allows comparison across projects.

### Cycle Time

The Cycle Time page plots individual issue cycle times on a scatter chart with a trend line. Three
percentile cards (p50, p75, p95) summarise the distribution. Each data point is annotated with its
DORA band. Epics and sub-tasks are excluded from all cycle time calculations. Supports per-board
filtering and week/quarter time range toggles. Cycle times are measured in **working days** by
default (weekends and configured public holidays excluded); the unit label adapts to "calendar days"
when weekend exclusion is disabled.

### Support

The Support page reports reactive support load across boards. Tickets are classified as support
via per-board rules (issue type, label, or link), and the page shows the percentage of work that
was reactive support alongside p50 and p95 support cycle times, with a per-board breakdown. Like
DORA and Cycle Time, it supports quarter, sprint, explicit date range, and rolling time-period
(7/30/90-day) views.

### Planning (Sprint)

The Planning page provides a per-sprint breakdown for Scrum boards: issue count, story points,
completion rate, and scope change percentage. Sprint membership history is reconstructed from the
Jira changelog so that issues added or removed mid-sprint are counted accurately. Active sprints
are flagged in the UI.

### Planning (Kanban)

Kanban boards have no sprints. The Planning page adapts to show issues grouped by the week or
quarter in which they first entered the board (board-entry date derived from changelog). Completion
rate and throughput are shown per period. The `dataStartDate` board config field prevents old
backlog issues from inflating Kanban period counts.

### Roadmap Accuracy

The Roadmap page tracks whether delivered issues were backed by an active Jira Product Discovery
(JPD) idea. Two metrics are reported:

- **Roadmap Coverage** — percentage of completed issues that are linked (via epic) to a JPD idea
  that was active during the delivery period.
- **Roadmap Delivery Rate** — percentage of covered issues that were actually completed.

A JPD idea is considered active only during its `startDate`–`targetDate` window. Both dates are
read from tenant-specific Polaris interval custom fields, configured in the Settings UI.

### Issue Gaps

The Gaps page surfaces hygiene problems in open work: issues missing an epic link or a story
point estimate, and issues that were completed without ever being planned into a sprint
("unplanned done"). It is a backlog-quality checklist rather than a metric — the same signals
feed the Healthcheck Stability score.

### Settings

The Settings page exposes per-board configuration (done status names, in-progress status names,
failure issue types, failure labels, failure link types, incident types, incident priorities,
recovery statuses, backlog status IDs, and data start date) and per-JPD-project configuration
(start date field ID, target date field ID). Changes are persisted to PostgreSQL and take effect
on the next data request without requiring a restart.

### Sync

A manual sync button in the Settings page triggers a full refresh of sprints, issues, changelogs,
versions, and JPD ideas from Jira. Sync status and last-synced timestamps are displayed per board.
Sync history (issue count, status, error messages) is stored in the `sync_logs` table.

### Working-Time Calculation

Cycle time and lead time durations exclude weekends (and optionally configured public holidays) by
default. The `WorkingTimeService` walks calendar boundaries in the configured `TIMEZONE` using
`Intl.DateTimeFormat` with a binary-search algorithm to handle Daylight Saving Time correctly.
MTTR is measured in **calendar hours** (incidents are production events that do not pause on
weekends). Deployment frequency uses **calendar days** (unchanged). Weekend exclusion and the
working-day definition are configurable via the `workingTime:` stanza in `boards.yaml` or through
`GET /api/config`.

### Admin tools

Three admin-only pages (visible only to users with the `admin` role) support operating the
dashboard:

- **API Keys** (`/api-keys`) — generate, list, and revoke personal API keys used to authenticate
  programmatic access such as the MCP server. Keys are shown once at creation and carry the
  creating user's access level. See [AI Assistant Integration (MCP)](#ai-assistant-integration-mcp).
- **Users** (`/users`) — view all users and promote them between the `user` (read-only) and
  `admin` roles. The first user to log in is auto-promoted to admin.
- **Debug** (`/debug`) — inspect everything stored in the PostgreSQL mirror for a single Jira
  ticket (issue row, changelog, sprint memberships, issue links, linked roadmap ideas), plus
  per-board DORA snapshot status and sync status. Read-only; reflects the cache, not live Jira.

---

## AI Assistant Integration (MCP)

Fragile ships an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server —
[`@fragile.app/mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fragile.app/mcp) — that lets AI assistants
query the metrics dashboard directly. Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any other MCP-compatible client
can invoke tools like `get_dora_metrics` or run prompt templates like `dora_health_report` without
manual API calls or copy-pasting from the UI.

The MCP server is a standalone subprocess that calls the Fragile REST API over HTTP. It requires
no database access and makes no Jira API calls — all data comes from the PostgreSQL cache
maintained by the sync service.

### Quick setup

**Claude Desktop** — add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
(macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fragile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@fragile.app/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.your-fragile-domain.com",
        "API_KEY": "frg_your_generated_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fragile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@fragile.app/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.your-fragile-domain.com",
        "API_KEY": "frg_your_generated_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client. The Fragile tools appear in the tool picker immediately.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `API_BASE_URL` | **Yes** | Base URL of the Fragile API, e.g. `https://api.your-fragile-domain.com` or `http://localhost:3001` for local use |
| `API_KEY` | **Yes** | A personal Fragile API key (generated in the app under **API Keys**). Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. The API requires authentication — an unset/invalid key returns 401. |

### Available tools (19)

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **DORA** | `get_dora_metrics`, `get_dora_trend`, `get_snapshot_status` |
| **Planning** | `get_planning_accuracy`, `list_sprints`, `list_quarters` |
| **Cycle time** | `get_cycle_time`, `get_cycle_time_trend` |
| **Sprint** | `get_sprint_detail`, `get_sprint_report` |

| **Sync** | `get_sync_status` |
| **Gaps** | `get_hygiene_gaps`, `get_unplanned_done` |

All tools are read-only — no tool triggers a mutation in Fragile or Jira.

### Prompt templates (4)

Pre-canned multi-tool workflows that return a structured Markdown report in a single invocation:

| Prompt | What it produces |
|---|---|
| `dora_health_report` | Org-level DORA bands, per-board breakdown, 4-quarter trend, and data freshness |
| `sprint_retrospective` | Planning accuracy, ticket-level classification, scope changes, and recommendations for a sprint |
| `release_readiness` | Readiness verdict combining sprint completion, DORA signals, hygiene gaps, and unplanned work |
| `quarterly_planning_review` | Cross-board planning accuracy, DORA aggregate, roadmap coverage, and observations for leadership |

See [`apps/mcp/README.md`](apps/mcp/README.md) for full documentation, including the resource
URIs (`boards://list`, `boards://{boardId}/config`) and local development instructions.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or later** (both backend and frontend)
- **PostgreSQL 16** — Docker is the simplest path (see Quick Start); an existing PostgreSQL
  instance works equally well
- **Docker** (optional, but recommended for running PostgreSQL locally)
- **A Jira Cloud account** with:
  - At least one Jira Software project (Scrum or Kanban)
  - An API token (see [Jira Setup](#jira-setup))
  - Optionally, one or more Jira Product Discovery projects for roadmap accuracy

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/fragile.git
cd fragile
```

### 2. Start PostgreSQL

Using Docker (recommended):

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name fragile-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=fragile \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16-alpine
```

Or use the provided Docker Compose file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> **Note:** `docker-compose.yml` defaults to the database name `fragile`. If you want to use
> a different name, edit both `docker-compose.yml` (the `POSTGRES_DB`
> environment variable) and `DB_DATABASE` in `backend/.env` to match.

### 3. Configure the backend

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Edit `backend/.env` and fill in your Jira credentials:

```dotenv
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://yourorg.atlassian.net
JIRA_USER_EMAIL=you@yourorg.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_DATABASE=fragile
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
TIMEZONE=UTC

# Google OAuth (see Google OAuth Setup section)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAIN=yourorg.com
SESSION_SECRET=run-openssl-rand-hex-64-to-generate
```

> **Note:** `JIRA_BOARD_IDS` has been removed from the `.env` file. Boards are now registered
> through the Settings UI or via `backend/config/boards.yaml` (see
> [YAML Configuration](#yaml-configuration) below).

### 3a. Configure boards and roadmaps via YAML (recommended)

Fragile can pre-populate its board and roadmap configuration from two YAML files that live in
`backend/config/`. This is the recommended setup path — it is faster than configuring everything
through the Settings UI and can be committed to version control.

Copy the annotated example files:

```bash
cp backend/config/boards.example.yaml backend/config/boards.yaml
cp backend/config/roadmap.example.yaml backend/config/roadmap.yaml
```

These files are in `.gitignore` by default (they contain deployment-specific values). The
`*.example.yaml` templates are tracked in git and serve as the canonical field reference.

Both files are read by `YamlConfigService` on every application startup. Values in the YAML
files **overwrite** matching database rows on each restart. Boards or roadmaps in the database
that are absent from the YAML files are left untouched. This means partial YAML is safe — you
only need to list the boards you want to seed or override.

**`backend/config/boards.yaml`**

```yaml
boards:
  # Scrum board
  - boardId: ACC            # Jira project key — must be unique, normalised to UPPERCASE
    boardType: scrum        # "scrum" or "kanban"
    doneStatusNames:
      - Done
      - Released
    inProgressStatusNames:
      - In Progress
      - In Review
    cancelledStatusNames:
      - Cancelled
      - "Won't Do"
    failureIssueTypes:      # Issue types that count toward Change Failure Rate
      - Bug
      - Incident
    failureLinkTypes:       # Link type names that flag a failure relationship
      - "is caused by"
      - "caused by"
    failureLabels:          # Issue labels that mark a deployment failure
      - regression
      - hotfix
    incidentIssueTypes:     # Issue types used for MTTR calculation
      - Bug
      - Incident
    recoveryStatusNames:    # Status names that mark incident resolution (MTTR end)
      - Done
      - Resolved
    incidentLabels: []      # Additional labels for incident detection
    incidentPriorities:
      - Critical
    backlogStatusIds: []    # Status IDs representing pre-board backlog (Kanban only)
    dataStartDate: null     # ISO date or null — lower bound for Kanban flow metrics

  # Kanban board — note backlogStatusIds and dataStartDate
  - boardId: PLAT
    boardType: kanban
    doneStatusNames:
      - Done
      - Released
    inProgressStatusNames:
      - In Progress
    cancelledStatusNames:
      - Cancelled
    failureIssueTypes:
      - Bug
    failureLinkTypes:
      - "is caused by"
    failureLabels:
      - regression
    incidentIssueTypes:
      - Bug
    recoveryStatusNames:
      - Done
    incidentLabels: []
    incidentPriorities:
      - Critical
    backlogStatusIds:
      - "10303"             # Jira status ID for the backlog column — issues here are excluded
    dataStartDate: "2024-01-01"   # Exclude issues that entered the board before this date
```

**`backend/config/roadmap.yaml`**

```yaml
roadmaps:
  - jpdKey: DISC                          # Jira Product Discovery project key
    description: "Discovery roadmap"       # Optional human-readable label
    startDateFieldId: "customfield_10015"  # Custom field ID for the idea start date
    targetDateFieldId: "customfield_10021" # Custom field ID for the idea target/end date

  - jpdKey: STRAT
    description: "Strategic initiatives"
    startDateFieldId: null    # null = field not mapped; ideas excluded from coverage
    targetDateFieldId: null
```

To find the custom field IDs for JPD date fields, see [Configuring JPD date fields](#configuring-jpd-date-fields).

If either YAML file is absent at startup, the application starts normally and all configuration
falls back to the Settings UI — no error is raised and no migration is required.

### 4. Configure the frontend

```bash
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

`frontend/.env` only needs one variable:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 5. Install dependencies

```bash
make install
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 6. Run database migrations

The backend must be compiled before migrations can run because `data-source.ts` references
compiled output in `dist/`.

```bash
make migrate
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd backend && npm run build && npm run migration:run
```

### 7. Start the development servers

Open two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (NestJS, port 3001)
make dev-api

# Terminal 2 — frontend (Next.js, port 3000)
make dev-web
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 8. Trigger the first sync

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You will be redirected to
Google login. The **first person to log in becomes the admin** automatically. After logging in,
navigate to **Settings** in the sidebar and click **Sync now**. The initial sync may take a
minute or two depending on the number of issues and boards. Subsequent syncs are incremental.

## Jira Setup

### Permissions required

The Jira account used for the API token needs the following permissions on each project:

- **Browse projects** — to read issues and sprints
- **View development tools** — to read changelogs and fix versions
- If using Jira Product Discovery: **View ideas** on each JPD project

A read-only service account is recommended for production deployments.

### Obtaining a Jira API token

1. Log in to [https://id.atlassian.com](https://id.atlassian.com).
2. Navigate to **Security** > **API tokens**.
3. Click **Create API token**, give it a label (e.g. `fragile`), and copy the token.
4. Paste the token into `JIRA_API_TOKEN` in `backend/.env`.
5. Set `JIRA_USER_EMAIL` to the email address of the account that owns the token.

### Finding project keys

Project keys are the uppercase prefix before issue numbers (e.g. `ACC` in `ACC-123`). They
appear in the URL when you open a Jira project: `https://yourorg.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/ACC/boards`.

Add an entry for each project key you want to track in `backend/config/boards.yaml` under the
`boards` list (see [YAML Configuration](#yaml-configuration)). Alternatively, boards can be
added through the Settings UI after the application is running.

### Board type detection

Board type (Scrum vs Kanban) is stored in the `BoardConfig` entity. After the first sync you can
update `boardType` for each board through the Settings UI or directly in the database.

- **Scrum boards** support sprint-based Planning metrics.
- **Kanban boards** use changelog-derived board-entry dates for Planning metrics. Sprint Planning
  metrics are not available for Kanban boards.

### Configuring JPD date fields

Roadmap accuracy depends on reading start and target dates from JPD ideas. These dates are stored
in tenant-specific Polaris interval custom fields (type `jira.polaris:interval`). The field IDs
differ between Jira tenants and must be configured manually:

1. In the Jira admin, go to **Project settings** > **Fields** for your JPD project and note the
   custom field IDs for the start date and target date interval fields. Field IDs look like
   `customfield_10056`.
2. Alternatively, fetch any JPD idea via the API and inspect the field keys in the response to
   identify which field holds the interval data.
3. In Fragile, go to **Settings** > **Roadmap configs** and enter the field IDs for each JPD
   project. Fragile will read `{"start":"YYYY-MM-DD","end":"YYYY-MM-DD"}` from those fields and
   use `start` as `startDate` and `end` as `targetDate`.

### Roadmap accuracy: delivery issue links

For an issue to count as roadmap-covered, it must be linked to an Epic that is in turn linked to
a JPD idea via a delivery issue link. The default delivery link type names recognised by Fragile
are:

- `is delivered by` / `delivers`

These link types are created automatically when you connect Jira Software delivery tickets to JPD
ideas using the native **Delivery** panel in JPD.

If your Jira instance uses different delivery link type names (e.g. `is implemented by` /
`implements`), update `jpdDeliveryLinkInward` and `jpdDeliveryLinkOutward` in the `jira:` stanza
of `backend/config/boards.yaml` (see [`jira:` stanza](#backendconfigboardsyaml--jira-stanza-optional-top-level))
or set the values through the Settings UI.

---

## Google OAuth Setup

Fragile uses Google Workspace SSO for authentication. Only users in the configured Google
Workspace domain can access the application. Follow these steps to create the OAuth2 credentials.

### 1. Create a Google Cloud project (or use an existing one)

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select or create a project (e.g. `fragile-internal`).
3. Ensure the project is associated with your Google Workspace organisation.

### 2. Configure the OAuth consent screen

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**.
2. Select **Internal** as the user type (this restricts access to users within your Google
   Workspace domain — no external users can authenticate).
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **App name:** `Fragile` (or your preferred display name)
   - **User support email:** your team's email
   - **Authorised domain:** your domain (e.g. `mypassglobal.com`)
4. Under **Scopes**, add:
   - `openid`
   - `email`
   - `profile`
5. Save.

### 3. Create OAuth2 credentials

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
2. Click **Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
3. Application type: **Web application**.
4. Name: `Fragile Backend` (or similar).
5. Under **Authorised JavaScript origins**, add the URL the app is served from (the
   Google Identity Services button runs client-side, so origins — not redirect URIs —
   are what matter):
   - For local development: `http://localhost:3000`
   - For production: `https://app.your-domain.com`
6. Click **Create**.
7. Copy the **Client ID**. (No client secret is needed — the app uses the Google Identity Services **ID-token flow**, which verifies the token server-side against the client ID.)

### 4. Configure environment variables

Add the following to `backend/.env` (local development) or populate the corresponding
Secrets Manager values (production):

```dotenv
# Google OAuth2 (ID-token flow — no client secret required)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789-abcdef.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAIN=mypassglobal.com

# Session (JWT cookie signing)
SESSION_SECRET=generate-a-random-64-byte-hex-string
SESSION_MAX_AGE_MS=604800000
```

The frontend also needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (same client ID) so the
"Sign in with Google" button can initialise.

> **Build-time, not runtime:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are inlined into the Next.js
> bundle **when the image is built**, not read at runtime. `make ecr-push` bakes the client
> ID into the frontend image automatically — it reads the `google_client_id` Terraform
> output (set via `google_client_id` in `terraform.tfvars`), the same way it resolves the
> API URL. Set `google_client_id` in `terraform.tfvars` and run `terraform apply` before
> building. Setting the value only on the ECS task has no effect and the button will fail
> with `Missing required parameter: client_id`.

Generate a session secret:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 64
```

### 5. Production deployment (AWS)

The backend reads `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `SESSION_SECRET` from Secrets Manager (injected
into the ECS task). The client ID is **public**, so it is managed by Terraform via the
`google_client_id` variable in `terraform.tfvars` — `terraform apply` writes it into the
`fragile/prod/google-client-id` secret. Only the session secret must be set out-of-band:

| Secret | Source |
|---|---|
| `fragile/prod/google-client-id` → `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | `google_client_id` in `terraform.tfvars` (via `terraform apply`) |
| `fragile/prod/session-secret` → `SESSION_SECRET` | Set out-of-band (it is a real secret) |

Set the session secret via the AWS Console or CLI (once):

```bash
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
  --secret-id fragile/prod/session-secret \
  --secret-string "$(openssl rand -hex 64)"
```

Set `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAIN` as a plain environment variable in the ECS task
definition (it is not a secret).

### 6. First login (admin bootstrap)

After deployment, the first person to log in is automatically promoted to **admin**. This
bootstraps the admin role without requiring manual database intervention. Subsequent users
receive the `user` role (read-only access). Admins can promote other users via
**Settings** > **Users**.

### Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| `user` | All dashboard views (read-only) |
| `admin` | All views + Settings (board config, user management) + Sync trigger |

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "Access denied" after Google login | Email domain doesn't match `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAIN` | Check the user's email domain matches the configured value |
| Redirect loops / "origin not allowed" on login | The app's origin isn't in **Authorised JavaScript origins** in GCP | Add the exact origin (scheme + host + port, no path), e.g. `http://localhost:3000` |
| "Internal" consent screen not available | GCP project not associated with a Google Workspace org | Link the project to your Workspace admin |
| Session lost after deploy | `SESSION_SECRET` changed between deploys | Use a stable secret; rotate only intentionally |

## Configuration Guide

Configuration can be managed in two ways:

- **Settings UI** — navigate to `/settings` in the browser. Changes are persisted to PostgreSQL
  immediately and take effect on the next data request without a restart.
- **YAML files** — edit `backend/config/boards.yaml` and `backend/config/roadmap.yaml` before
  starting the backend. Values in YAML overwrite the database on every startup. See
  [YAML Configuration](#yaml-configuration) for the full workflow.

For a step-by-step walkthrough including how to find tenant-specific Jira field IDs, see
[`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md).

### `GET /api/config`

The backend exposes a lightweight config endpoint consumed by the frontend to adapt its UI labels:

```json
{
  "timezone": "Australia/Sydney",
  "excludeWeekends": true
}
```

`excludeWeekends: true` causes the frontend to show "working days" as the unit for cycle time and
lead time cards; `false` shows "calendar days".

### Board configuration

Each board has an editable configuration block. The fields are:

| Field | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Board type** | `scrum` or `kanban` | `scrum` |
| **Done status names** | Status names that count as "deployed / complete" for Deployment Frequency and Lead Time | `Done, Closed, Released` |
| **In-progress status names** | First transition to one of these statuses marks cycle time start | `In Progress` |
| **Failure issue types** | Issue types that contribute to Change Failure Rate | `Bug, Incident` |
| **Failure labels** | Issue labels that flag a failure | `regression, incident, hotfix` |
| **Failure link types** | Issue link type names that indicate a deployment caused a failure | `is caused by, caused by` |
| **Incident issue types** | Issue types used to identify incidents for MTTR | `Bug, Incident` |
| **Incident priorities** | Priorities that qualify an issue as an incident | `Critical` |
| **Incident labels** | Labels used to identify incidents | _(empty)_ |
| **Recovery statuses** | Status names that indicate an incident is resolved (MTTR end) | `Done, Resolved` |
| **Backlog status IDs** | Status IDs representing the pre-board backlog state (Kanban only) | _(empty)_ |
| **Data start date** | ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) — Kanban issues that entered the board before this date are excluded from flow metrics | _(none)_ |

### Roadmap configuration

Each Jira Product Discovery project that you want to use for roadmap accuracy tracking needs a
configuration entry. The fields are:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **JPD project key** | The project key of the JPD project, e.g. `ROADMAP` |
| **Description** | Optional human-readable label |
| **Start date field ID** | Custom field ID for the interval field used as the idea start date |
| **Target date field ID** | Custom field ID for the interval field used as the idea target date |

---

## YAML Configuration

Fragile's `YamlConfigService` reads two YAML files from `backend/config/` on every application
startup and upserts their contents into the `board_configs` and `roadmap_configs` database tables.
This provides a version-controllable, declarative alternative to configuring everything through
the Settings UI.

### How it works

- **YAML wins on conflict** — any field present in the YAML file overwrites the corresponding
  database row on restart.
- **Absent entries are untouched** — boards or roadmaps in the database but not listed in the
  YAML file are left unchanged.
- **Partial entries are safe** — if a field is omitted from a YAML entry (not `null`, but
  entirely absent), the existing database value for that field is preserved.
- **Startup validation** — both files are parsed and validated with Zod at startup. Invalid YAML
  causes the application to refuse to start, printing a clear error listing every offending field.
- **Optional** — if either file is missing the application starts normally, logs a warning, and
  falls back entirely to the Settings UI. No error is raised.

### File locations

| File | Default path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `boards.yaml` | `backend/config/boards.yaml` | Board metric rules (one entry per Jira project) |
| `roadmap.yaml` | `backend/config/roadmap.yaml` | JPD project date-field mappings |
| `boards.example.yaml` | `backend/config/boards.example.yaml` | Annotated template — tracked in git |
| `roadmap.example.yaml` | `backend/config/roadmap.example.yaml` | Annotated template — tracked in git |
| `backend.tf` | `infra/terraform/environments/prod/backend.tf` | Terraform S3 backend config (bucket name, state key) |
| `backend.tf.example` | `infra/terraform/environments/prod/backend.tf.example` | Annotated template — tracked in git |

Both live files (`boards.yaml` and `roadmap.yaml`) are excluded from git via `.gitignore` because
they contain deployment-specific values. The `*.example.yaml` files serve as the canonical field
reference and are always tracked.

Override the default paths using environment variables in `backend/.env`:

```dotenv
BOARD_CONFIG_FILE=/absolute/path/to/boards.yaml
ROADMAP_CONFIG_FILE=/absolute/path/to/roadmap.yaml
```

### `backend/config/boards.yaml` — field reference

```yaml
boards:
  - boardId: ACC                 # (required) Jira project key. Normalised to UPPERCASE.
                                  #   Must be unique within the file.

                                  #   Scrum boards support sprint-based Planning metrics.
                                  #   Kanban boards use changelog-derived board-entry dates.

    doneStatusNames:              # (optional) Status names that count as "deployed / complete"
      - Done                      #   for Deployment Frequency and Lead Time.

      - "is caused by"            #   relationship between issues (CFR signal).
      - "caused by"               #   Default: ["is caused by", "caused by"]

    failureLabels:                # (optional) Jira labels that flag a deployment failure.
      - regression                #   Default: ["regression", "incident", "hotfix"]
      - incident

      - Incident                  #   Default: ["Bug", "Incident"]

    recoveryStatusNames:          # (optional) Transitioning to one of these statuses ends
      - Done                      #   the MTTR clock (incident resolved).
      - Resolved                  #   Default: ["Done", "Resolved"]

    incidentLabels: []            # (optional) Additional labels for incident identification.
                                  #   Default: []

    incidentPriorities:           # (optional) Priorities that qualify an issue as an incident.
      - Critical                  #   Default: ["Critical"]

    backlogStatusIds:             # (optional, Kanban only) Jira status IDs (not names) that
      - "10303"                   #   represent the pre-board backlog state. Issues whose
                                  #   current statusId is in this list are excluded from
                                  #   flow metrics. When empty, a changelog heuristic is used.
                                  #   Default: []

    dataStartDate: "2024-01-01"   # (optional, Kanban only) ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) or null.
                                  #   Hard lower bound — issues whose board-entry date is
                                  #   before this date are excluded from flow metrics.
                                  #   Prevents old backlog items inflating period counts.
                                  #   Default: null
```

### `backend/config/boards.yaml` — `jira:` stanza (optional, top-level)

In addition to the `boards:` list, `boards.yaml` accepts an optional top-level `jira:` key that
controls which Jira custom field IDs are used for story points and JPD delivery link types. All
fields inside the stanza are optional — any field omitted keeps its current database value.

```yaml
jira:
  # Story point field IDs — Fragile tries each in order and uses the first non-null value found.
  # List all field ID variants present in your Jira instance.
  # Default: all five IDs below.
  storyPointsFieldIds:
    - story_points          # legacy Jira Server / some older cloud projects
    - customfield_10016     # "Story point estimate" (classic projects)
    - customfield_10026     # "Story Points" (classic projects, older)
    - customfield_10028     # "Story Points" (some cloud instances)
    - customfield_11031     # "Story point estimate" (team-managed / next-gen)

  # Epic Link custom field — used for legacy epic relationships pre-dating Jira's parent field.
  # Set to null to disable and rely solely on the native parent field.
  # Default: "customfield_10014"
  epicLinkFieldId: customfield_10014

  # JPD delivery link type names — must match exactly what Jira shows on the issue link panel.
  # Accepts either a bare string or a list. Default: both values shown below.
  # Check by opening any delivery-linked issue in your Jira instance.
  jpdDeliveryLinkInward:
    - "is implemented by"
    - "is delivered by"
  jpdDeliveryLinkOutward:
    - "implements"
    - "delivers"
```

These values are stored in the `jira_field_config` table (singleton row, `id = 1`) and loaded once
per sync. If the `jira:` stanza is absent, the database values — seeded with the defaults above by
the `AddJiraFieldConfig` migration — are left untouched.

### `backend/config/boards.yaml` — `workingTime:` stanza (optional, top-level)

`boards.yaml` also accepts an optional top-level `workingTime:` key that controls how cycle-time
and lead-time durations are calculated. All fields inside the stanza are optional — any field
omitted keeps its current database value. If the entire stanza is absent, the defaults below
(Monday–Friday, 8 hours/day, no holidays, weekends excluded) are used.

```yaml
workingTime:
  # Set to false to measure cycle time and lead time in raw calendar days.
  # Default: true
  excludeWeekends: true

  # ISO weekday numbers that count as working days.
  # 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, …, 6 = Saturday.
  # Override for regions with a non-standard weekend (e.g. [0,1,2,3,4] for Sun–Thu).
  # Default: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  workDays:
    - 1  # Monday
    - 2  # Tuesday
    - 3  # Wednesday
    - 4  # Thursday
    - 5  # Friday

  # Number of working hours in a standard day. Used as the divisor when converting
  # raw working milliseconds into working-day units (raw_hours / hoursPerDay).
  # This is a normalisation factor, NOT a work-hours-per-day limit.
  # Default: 8
  hoursPerDay: 8

  # Public holidays to exclude from working-time calculations, in the tenant's
  # local timezone (set via TIMEZONE env var). Format: YYYY-MM-DD.
  # Default: []
  holidays:
    - "2026-01-01"  # New Year's Day
    - "2026-04-25"  # ANZAC Day (example)
```

These values are stored in the `working_time_config` table (singleton row, `id = 1`) and take
effect on the next data request without a restart. MTTR is always measured in calendar hours
regardless of this configuration — incidents are production events that do not pause on weekends.

### `backend/config/roadmap.yaml` — field reference

```yaml
roadmaps:
  - jpdKey: DISC                          # (required) Jira Product Discovery project key.
                                           #   Must be unique within the file.

    description: "Discovery roadmap"       # (optional) Human-readable label shown in the
                                           #   Settings UI. Default: null

    startDateFieldId: "customfield_10015"  # (optional) Jira custom field ID that stores the
                                           #   idea start date (type: jira.polaris:interval).
                                           #   null means the field is unmapped; ideas without
                                           #   a start date are excluded from coverage.
                                           #   Default: null

    targetDateFieldId: "customfield_10021" # (optional) Jira custom field ID that stores the
                                           #   idea target / delivery date.
                                           #   Same discovery method as startDateFieldId.
                                           #   Default: null
```

To find your tenant's custom field IDs, see [Configuring JPD date fields](#configuring-jpd-date-fields).

### Setup order of operations

1. Copy both example files:

   ```bash
   cp backend/config/boards.example.yaml backend/config/boards.yaml
   cp backend/config/roadmap.example.yaml backend/config/roadmap.yaml
   ```

2. Edit `backend/config/boards.yaml` — add one entry per board, set `boardType`, and adjust
   status and metric rules to match your Jira workflow.

3. Edit `backend/config/roadmap.yaml` — add one entry per JPD project, filling in the
   `customfield_xxxxx` IDs for `startDateFieldId` and `targetDateFieldId`.

4. Start the backend (`make dev-api`). Watch the startup logs for confirmation:
   ```
   [YamlConfigService] YAML config: 6 board config(s) applied from boards.yaml
   [YamlConfigService] YAML config: 2 roadmap config(s) applied from roadmap.yaml
   ```

5. Trigger a sync from the Settings UI to populate issue data for the configured boards.

6. Fine-tune individual board settings through the Settings UI at any time. Changes made in
   the UI persist to the database. On the next restart, only fields explicitly present in the
   YAML file will overwrite those values — omitted fields are always preserved.

### `docker-compose.yml`

The included `docker-compose.yml` starts a PostgreSQL 16 container. Edit it if you need to
change the database name, port, or credentials:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    container_name: ai-starter-db
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"      # host:container — change the left side if port 5432 is taken
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: fragile
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

If you rename `POSTGRES_DB`, update `DB_DATABASE` in `backend/.env` to the same value before
running migrations.

### Key design decisions

All Jira API calls are routed through a single typed `JiraClient` service in `backend/src/jira/`.
No metric service or controller calls Jira directly. This keeps the integration surface contained
and makes the services independently testable.

Calculation logic lives entirely in NestJS services. Controllers only handle request parsing,
response shaping, and delegation to services. No business logic appears in controllers.

Board configuration (done status names, failure rules, incident rules) is stored in the
`board_configs` table and loaded at runtime. Nothing metric-related is hardcoded.

Epics and sub-tasks are excluded from all metric calculations at the query layer. This is enforced
in the sync service and in all metric service queries.

Sprint membership history for Scrum boards is reconstructed from the `jira_changelogs` table
(field: `Sprint`). Jira does not expose a point-in-time snapshot of sprint membership, so
changelog replay is the authoritative source.

For the full rationale behind each of these decisions, see the ADRs in `docs/decisions/`.

## Data Model

The following TypeORM entities form the core data model. All entities map to snake_case table
names in PostgreSQL.

## Migrations

Migration files live in `backend/src/migrations/`. All migrations have reversible `up` and `down`
methods.

```bash
# Run all pending migrations
cd backend && npm run build && npm run migration:run

# Revert the most recent migration
cd backend && npm run migration:revert

# Generate a new migration from entity changes
cd backend && npm run migration:generate -- src/migrations/DescriptiveName
```

> The migration CLI uses `dist/` paths, so `npm run build` must be run before `migration:run`
> or `migration:revert`.

## Contributing

Design decisions in this project follow a proposal-then-ADR workflow:

1. **Before implementing** any significant change — a new module, a schema change affecting
   multiple entities, a new Jira API integration point, or a cross-cutting concern — write a
   proposal in `docs/proposals/` using the template and naming convention described in that
   directory's README.

2. **After the proposal is accepted**, record the decision as an Architecture Decision Record in
   `docs/decisions/`. ADRs are immutable once written; superseded decisions are marked as such
   and linked to the replacement ADR.

3. Calculation logic belongs in services, not controllers. All Jira HTTP calls belong in
   `JiraClient`, not in any other service. Board configuration must come from the database, not
   from environment variables or hardcoded values.

4. TypeScript is strict mode throughout. The backend uses semicolons and `.js` extension ESM
   imports. The frontend uses no semicolons. Match the style of the file you are editing.

5. Migrations must be reversible. Every `up` must have a corresponding `down`.

Pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue or discussion first for any change that would
affect the data model, the Jira sync strategy, or the metric calculation logic.
