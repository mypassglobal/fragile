/**
 * healthcheck-compute.ts
 *
 * Pure per-board Healthcheck computation (ADR 0070/0071/0073). No DB, no I/O —
 * the service loads data and injects it (including resolver callbacks for
 * sprint-membership and roadmap-link lookups, which require pre-loaded state).
 *
 * Model: the denominator D is the set of issues whose FIRST-EVER start
 * transition falls within the week window:
 *   - scrum:  first transition into an `inProgressStatuses` status
 *   - kanban: first transition into a `boardEntryStatuses` status
 *
 * Each score = (100 / |D|) * numerator (see healthcheck-scoring.ts):
 *   - Stability (scrum only): started tickets that were committed/carry-over at
 *     their sprint start (resolved via `committedKeysAt`).
 *   - Roadmap  (scrum only): started tickets that are roadmap-linked
 *     (membership — `isRoadmapLinked`).
 *   - Support  (all boards): started tickets classified as support.
 *
 * When `includeSupport` is false, support tickets are removed from the
 * Stability/Roadmap denominator and numerators (Support is never affected).
